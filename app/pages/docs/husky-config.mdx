[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is a tool that helps improve
your commits.

You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc...
when you commit or push using
[Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).

For example, a `pre-commit` hook is triggered just before a commit is
created.

## Default Blitz config {#blitz-config}

By default, new Blitz apps install a pre-commit and pre-push hook inside
`.husky/` in the project root. You can view these hooks
[here](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/packages/generator/templates/app/.husky)

Husky is installed after you use npm or yarn to install your package
dependencies following this instruction in the package.json file:

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

Note that if you use Yarn 2, husky needs to be installed differently. Yarn
2 doesn't support prepare lifecycle script. See
[Yarn 2 install](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=yarn-2).

## Troubleshooting Husky {#troubleshooting}

If you are having problems commiting or pushing, check out the Husky
[troubleshooting](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=troubleshoot)
guide.

To optionally bypass checks, you can run
`git commit -m "message" --noverify` or `git push --no-verify`
